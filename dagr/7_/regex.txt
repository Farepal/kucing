Sure, here's a detailed explanation of the special characters used in regular expressions:

1. **^**: The caret symbol is used to check if a string starts with a certain character or sequence. For example, `^Hello` will match any string that starts with 'Hello'. If used inside a character set (`[^...]`), it negates the set, matching anything not enclosed in the brackets.

2. **$**: This character is used to check if a string ends with a certain character or sequence. For example, `world$` will match any string that ends with 'world'.

3. **.**: The dot character matches any single character except the newline character. For example, `h.t` will match 'hat', 'hot', 'hit', etc., but not 'heat'.

4. **\***: The asterisk means zero or more occurrences of the pattern left to it. For example, `ho*` will match 'h', 'ho', 'hoo', 'hooo', etc.

5. **+**: Plus means one or more occurrences of the pattern left to it. For example, `ho+` will match 'ho', 'hoo', 'hooo', etc., but not 'h'.

6. **?**: Question mark means zero or one occurrence of the pattern left to it. For example, `ho?` will match 'h' and 'ho', but not 'hoo'.

7. **{}**: Braces contain two numbers separated by a comma, and define the minimum and maximum number of occurrences. For example, `ho{1,2}` will match 'ho' and 'hoo', but not 'h' or 'hooo'.

8. **[]**: Square brackets specify a set of characters you wish to match. For example, `[hH]at` will match both 'hat' and 'Hat'. A hyphen can be used to specify a range, e.g., `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter, and `[0-9]` matches any digit.

9. **()**: Parentheses are used to group sub-patterns. For example, `(a|b|c)xz` match any string that matches either 'axz', 'bxz', or 'cxz'.

10. **\|**: The pipe symbol works as a logical OR. Matches the pattern before or the pattern after the symbol. For example, `h|t` will match 'h' or 't'.

11. **\**: Backslashes are used to escape special characters. For example, `h\.t` will match 'h.t'. It's also used to denote certain special sequences:

    - `\d`: Matches any digit (0-9).
    - `\D`: Matches any non-digit character.
    - `\w`: Matches any word character (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`).
    - `\W`: Matches any non-word character.
    - `\s`: Matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line breaks).
    - `\S`: Matches any non-whitespace character.
    - `\b`: Matches a word boundary.
    - `\B`: Matches a non-word boundary.

12. **(?i)**: This turns on case-insensitive matching. For example, `(?i)abc` will match 'abc', 'ABC', 'AbC', etc.

13. **(?=)**: Positive lookahead. Matches a group after the main expression without including it in the result. For example, `abc(?=def)` will match 'abc' only if it's followed by 'def'.

14. **(?!)**: Negative lookahead. Matches a group after the main expression only if it's not followed by a certain group. For example, `abc(?!def)` will match 'abc' only if it's not followed by 'def'.

15. **(?<=)**: Positive lookbehind. Matches a group before the main expression without including it in the result. For example, `(?<=abc)def` will match 'def' only if it's preceded by 'abc'.

16. **(?<!)**: Negative lookbehind. Matches a group before the main expression only if it's not preceded by a certain group. For example, `(?<!abc)def` will match 'def' only if it's not preceded by 'abc'.

These are the most commonly used special characters and sequences in regular expressions. Regular expressions can be much more complex and powerful by combining these special characters and using other features of the regular expression syntax.
